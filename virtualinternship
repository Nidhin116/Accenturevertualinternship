Task assigned for a data analyst

- An analysis of their content categories that highlight the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity

Data sets Available:

- content
- Location
- Profile
- Reactions
- Reaction Type
- Sessions
- User

Required Data sets

- Content
- Reactions
- Reaction Type

Since we are trying to identify the top 5 categories based on popularity, we need to identify datasets with relevant information that can be merged together.

Used R-

uploaded all the datasets in R.

Merged reaction dataset with content set using content id

```r
merge(DF1,DF2, by.x="",by.y="")
```

Then merged this new dataset with the reaction type dataset using reaction type and crated the final dataset.

Renamed some columns for ease to understand 

```r
colnames(socialbuzz)[4] <- "user_id"
```

After changing the colname, Identified unwanted characters in the column 

```r
str_replace_all(socialbuzz$Con_category, "[^[:alnum:]]", "")
## found this code on: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-all-special-characters-from-string-in-r/
```

After cleaning downloaded the table as csv

```r
write.table(accenture_clean,file = "socialbuzz1.csv",row.names=F, sep=",")
```

Final dataset cleaned and to be submitted
